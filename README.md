Python dependencies.

## 0. Prerequisites

To run the benchmark, please use a computer/virtual machine with
* Ubuntu 20.04 (preferred)
* at least 64GB of RAM (it might even swap)
* at least 1500GB of free disk space for storing the converted input datasets
* at least 150h of computing time

If those requirements are too heavy, you can
* reduce the number of downloaded datasets (default max size: 1024MB)
* reduce the resampling size (default: 192 for a grid of 192^3 vertices)

## 1. Installing the dependencies

```sh
# install build dependencies
$ sudo apt install g++ cmake python-numpy pipx python3-dev python3-venv libeigen3-dev \
    julia default-jdk libtbb-dev libboost-dev python2-dev libopenmpi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
# install poetry with pipx
$ /usr/bin/python3 -m pipx install poetry
# install run-time dependencies
$ ~/.local/bin/poetry install
```

## 2. Building the missing software libraries

```sh
$ ~/.local/bin/poetry run python build_software.py
```

## 3. Fetching the OpenSciVis datasets (raw files) & converting them to supported input formats

```sh
$ ~/.local/bin/poetry run python main.py prepare_datasets -d
```

Use the `--max_dataset_size xxx` flag to change the number of downloaded
datasets (default 1024MB). Use the `--max_resample_size yyy` flag to
modify the resampled size (default 192 for a 192^3 grid)

## 4. Launch the Persistence Diagram computation

```sh
$ ~/.local/bin/poetry run python main.py compute_diagrams
```

Use the `--sequential` key to request a sequential execution (parallel
for TTK, Dipha and Oineus by default).

A whole run can up to 150h of computation time. To reduce it, the
flags `-1`, `-2` or `-3` can be used to specify the dimension of the
input dataset.

## 5. Observe the results

Once the previous step has been completed, timings results are stored
using the JSON format in a timestamped file. This text file can be
read using any text editor:

```sh
$ less results-*timestamp*.json
```

Python scripts inside the `plots` subfolder can generate LaTeX and/or
corresponding PDFs files that are reused in the "Discrete Morse
Sandwich: Fast Computation of Persistence Diagrams for Scalar Data â€“
An Algorithm and A Benchmark" TVCG article. In particular, Fig. 18 and
Fig. 19 can be generated with:

```sh
cd plots
python plot_vtu.py
```

This will generate two LaTeX files and the corresponding PDFs files
built with `latexmk`. These files are named `plot_expl_seq.pdf` for
the sequential results and `plots_expl_para.pdf` for the parallel
results (same names for the LaTeX source files).

Input data (result timings) is stored inside the `.json` files in the
same subfolder. Overwrite these and re-run the script to update the
PDFs.

### 6. Compute distances between diagrams

The script [./compute_mean_distances.py](compute_mean_distances.py) is
used to compare the pairs of every computed diagrams to a reference
(here the DiscreteMorseSandwich backend). The distance computation uses
a quick approach that detects and filters out identical pairs between
two diagrams. The Wasserstein distance is then computed on the
non-identical remaining pairs.

```sh
$ ~/.local/bin/poetry run python compute_mean_distances.py
```

The scripts returns the mean distance aggregated per backend.
